# GeodesicIMDVv2 --- Unified LOO-Inhibited IMDV

## Vision

GeodesicIMDVv2 models a cortical hypercolumn where **a single mechanism---the Leave-One-Out (LOO) shadow---drives both learning and activation sparsity**. In real neocortex, basket cell interneurons create lateral inhibition at the dendrite level: a minicolumn's dendrites are suppressed for input features already "claimed" by other minicolumns. This dendritic suppression has two effects:

1. **Learning (plasticity):** Only non-inhibited synapses undergo plasticity, forcing each minicolumn to specialize in unclaimed features.
2. **Activation (soma output):** The soma fires only if enough non-inhibited dendrites are active---if most of its preferred input is already explained by others, it stays silent.

The LOO shadow produces both effects from one computation. There is no separate inhibition parameter, no k-WTA, no beta---the inhibition topology emerges from the learned weight geometry itself.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Setup

- **Weight bank:** $W \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D}$, where $N$ is the number of templates (minicolumns) and $D$ is the input dimensionality. Each row $\mathbf{w}_i$ is a unit vector on the hypersphere $S^{D-1}$: $\|\mathbf{w}_i\| = 1$.
- **Input:** $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^D$, normalized to unit length: $\hat{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{x} / \|\mathbf{x}\|$.

### Step 1: Raw Similarities and Activations

$$s_i = \mathbf{w}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}$$

$$a_{\text{raw},i} = \max(s_i, 0)$$

$$A = \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{\text{raw},j}$$

These are standard cosine similarities, rectified. On positive-orthant data (like pixel images), most templates will have positive $s_i$, so $a_{\text{raw}}$ is dense (~89% active for MNIST).

### Step 2: Global Reconstruction

$$\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} a_{\text{raw},j} \cdot \mathbf{w}_j = \mathbf{a}_{\text{raw}}^\top W$$

This is the population's collective "explanation" of the input.

### Step 3: LOO Shadow (Dendrite-Level Inhibition)

For each template $i$, remove its contribution:

$$\mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i} = \mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} - a_{\text{raw},i} \cdot \mathbf{w}_i = \sum_{j \neq i} a_{\text{raw},j} \cdot \mathbf{w}_j$$

Normalize to the unit sphere:

$$\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{shadow},i} = \frac{\mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i}}{\|\mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i}\| + \epsilon}$$

**Biological interpretation:** $\mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i}$ represents the collective explanation with template $i$ removed---both its direction and strength. The unnormalized shadow drives **activation inhibition** (Step 4), while the normalized shadow $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{shadow},i}$ provides the **push direction** for learning (see Learning Rule below).

### Step 4: Shadow Overlap (Dendrite-to-Soma Projection)

$$\text{shadow overlap}_i = \mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i}$$

Note: this uses the **unnormalized** shadow vector, not $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{shadow},i}$. The inhibition therefore scales with the **magnitude** of the collective explanation, not just its direction. A population that barely explains the input inhibits weakly; a population that strongly explains it inhibits strongly.

Expanding:

$$\text{shadow overlap}_i = \mathbf{w}_i \cdot \sum_{j \neq i} a_{\text{raw},j} \cdot \mathbf{w}_j = \sum_{j \neq i} a_{\text{raw},j} \cdot (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j)$$

This is unbounded above (it grows with population size and activation strength):

- **Large positive**: Template $i$'s receptive field is heavily covered by strongly active, similar templates. Strong inhibition.
- **Near zero**: Either few templates are active, or those that are active are orthogonal to $i$. Weak inhibition.
- **Negative**: Template $i$ points away from the collective. Rare in practice.

### Step 5: LOO-Inhibited Activation (Soma Output)

$$a_i = \max(s_i - \text{shadow overlap}_i, \, 0) \cdot \|\mathbf{x}\|$$

The activation is the raw cosine similarity minus the strength-weighted redundancy with the collective, scaled by input magnitude. Templates that are redundant with a strong collective get suppressed; templates that capture unique structure---or that dominate a weak collective---survive.

This is the **unified output**---no separate inhibition mechanism.

---

## Learning Rule

The LOO shadow drives both the activation inhibition (above) and the weight update (below).

### Pull Force: Toward the Input

The geodesic tangent vector pointing from $\mathbf{w}_i$ toward $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ on the unit sphere:

$$\mathbf{v}_{\text{pull}} = \hat{\mathbf{x}} - (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}) \cdot \mathbf{w}_i$$

$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{pull},i} = \frac{\mathbf{v}_{\text{pull}}}{\|\mathbf{v}_{\text{pull}}\|}$$

**Biological interpretation:** This is the excitatory drive---the input "wants" the template to move toward it.

### Push Force: Away from the LOO Shadow

The geodesic tangent vector pointing from $\mathbf{w}_i$ toward $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{shadow},i}$:

$$\mathbf{v}_{\text{push}} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{shadow},i} - (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\text{shadow},i}) \cdot \mathbf{w}_i$$

$$\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{push},i} = \frac{\mathbf{v}_{\text{push}}}{\|\mathbf{v}_{\text{push}}\|}$$

**Biological interpretation:** The inhibited dendrites push the template *away from* what others already cover. This forces specialization.

### Inhibition Scaling

$$\text{inh}_i = \frac{A - a_{\text{raw},i}}{A + \epsilon}$$

This normalizes the inhibition to $[0, 1]$ and is dimension-invariant. Templates with high raw activation (relative to the population) receive less push, preserving their current specialization.

### Net Tangent

For **active** templates ($a_{\text{raw},i} > 0$):

$$\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{net},i} = (1 - \beta_{\text{bal}}) \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{pull},i} - (\beta_{\text{bal}} \cdot \text{inh}_i) \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{push},i}$$

For **inactive** templates ($a_{\text{raw},i} \leq 0$):

$$\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{net},i} = (1 - \beta_{\text{bal}}) \cdot \hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{pull},i}$$

Inactive templates receive only pull (toward the input). For templates with zero pull norm and zero activation, a random tangent vector is injected so they can explore.

The **balance** parameter $\beta_{\text{bal}} \in [0, 1]$ controls the excitatory/inhibitory tradeoff:
- $\beta_{\text{bal}} = 0$: Pure pull. All templates converge to the data centroid. No specialization.
- $\beta_{\text{bal}} = 1$: Pure push. Templates flee from each other. No learning from input.
- $\beta_{\text{bal}} = 0.5$: Equal pull and push. Good starting point.

### Geodesic Rotation (Rodrigues' Formula)

Templates are updated by rotating them on the hypersphere along the net tangent direction:

$$\theta_i = \eta \cdot \|\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{net},i}\|$$

$$\hat{\mathbf{r}}_i = \frac{\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{net},i}}{\|\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{net},i}\|}$$

$$\mathbf{w}_i^{\text{new}} = \mathbf{w}_i \cos(\theta_i) + \hat{\mathbf{r}}_i \sin(\theta_i)$$

$$\mathbf{w}_i^{\text{new}} \leftarrow \frac{\mathbf{w}_i^{\text{new}}}{\|\mathbf{w}_i^{\text{new}}\|}$$

Where $\eta$ is the **step fraction** (learning rate). The rotation preserves unit norm by construction (renormalization is a safety measure against floating-point drift).

---

## Relationship to Hyperpolarization

The classical subtractive lateral inhibition (implemented in the `Hyperpolarization` node) is:

$$a'_i = \max\!\Big(s_i - \beta \sum_{j \neq i} a_j, \, 0\Big)$$

Every other template inhibits you equally, weighted only by activation strength.

The LOO shadow inhibition is:

$$a'_i = \max(s_i - \mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i}, \, 0)$$

Expanding the unnormalized shadow overlap:

$$\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i} = \sum_{j \neq i} a_j \cdot (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j)$$

The inhibition from template $j$ onto template $i$ is $a_j \cdot (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j)$---the product of $j$'s activation and the **receptive field overlap** between $i$ and $j$. No normalization by shadow magnitude. This is a structured, template-specific generalization of hyperpolarization:

| Property | Hyperpolarization | LOO Shadow Inhibition |
|----------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Inhibition weight from $j$ to $i$ | $\beta \cdot a_j$ (uniform) | $a_j \cdot (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j)$ |
| Orthogonal templates | Still inhibit each other | Zero mutual inhibition |
| Similar templates | Same inhibition as dissimilar | Strong mutual inhibition |
| Scales with population activity | Yes (via $\sum a_j$) | Yes (via $\sum a_j \cdot \text{overlap}$) |
| Free parameters | $\beta$ (hand-tuned) | None (emerges from weights) |
| Biological analog | Generic basket cell | Receptive-field-specific inhibition |

**Hyperpolarization is the special case where all weight vectors overlap equally** ($\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j = \text{const}$ for all $i \neq j$). In that case, the LOO overlap reduces to $\text{const} \cdot \sum_{j \neq i} a_j$, recovering the classical form with $\beta = \text{const}$.

## How Sparsity Emerges

Sparsity emerges naturally:

1. **As templates specialize** (via push forces), their weight vectors become more dissimilar.
2. **Dissimilar templates have low mutual overlap** ($\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j \approx 0$), so they don't contribute to each other's shadow overlap.
3. **But templates that respond to the same input features** have high mutual overlap, so they strongly inhibit each other's output.
4. **Only the best match survives** among a group of similar templates, while templates detecting different features can coexist.

The sparsity level is not a parameter---it's a consequence of the weight geometry. Early in training (random weights, high mutual overlap), activations are dense. As learning progresses and templates spread apart, activations become sparser.

This is the same dynamic as in cortex: sparsity increases with learning as receptive fields become more selective.

---

## Properties of the Algorithm

### Locality

Every computation for template $i$ depends only on:
- The input $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$ (available to all templates via feedforward connections)
- Template $i$'s own weights $\mathbf{w}_i$
- The population reconstruction $\mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ (a single shared vector, computable by a pool of interneurons)

The LOO shadow $\mathbf{x}_{\text{shadow},i} = \mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}} - a_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_i$ only requires the global reconstruction minus self---a local subtraction. No template needs to know any other individual template's weights or activations.

### Online Learning

Each sample is processed independently. Weights are updated immediately after each sample (no batching, no gradient accumulation). This matches the biological constraint that synaptic plasticity operates on a per-stimulus timescale.

### Manifold Preservation

All operations respect the unit hypersphere geometry:
- Tangent vectors are projected to be perpendicular to $\mathbf{w}_i$ (tangent to the sphere)
- Weight updates use Rodrigues' rotation (geodesic transport)
- Renormalization ensures numerical stability

Templates never leave the sphere. Their magnitude is always 1. The input magnitude $\|\mathbf{x}\|$ is factored out and multiplied back into the output activations.

### No Silent Templates

Inactive templates (those in the negative hemisphere relative to the input) receive a pull force toward the input. Combined with random tangent injection for templates with zero pull norm, this ensures all templates eventually find a region of input space to specialize in.

### Feedback Modulation

An optional feedback port allows top-down signals to modulate the pull force per-template. This enables hierarchical plasticity: higher layers can gate which templates learn from the current input. When feedback is absent, all templates receive uniform pull scaling.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Role |
|-----------|---------|------|
| `amount` | 25 | Number of templates (minicolumns) |
| `dim` | 784 | Dimensionality of each template |

| `step_fraction` | 0.1 | Learning rate (geodesic rotation fraction) |
| `is_learning` | True | Enable/disable weight updates |

Note: **there is no sparsity parameter**. Sparsity is an emergent property of the LOO shadow inhibition and the learned weight geometry.

## Outputs

| Port | Content |
|------|---------|
| `weights` | Current weight matrix $W$ ($N \times D$) |
| `activations` | LOO-inhibited activations $\mathbf{a} \cdot \|\mathbf{x}\|$ |
| `raw_activations` | Raw cosine activations $\mathbf{a}_{\text{raw}} \cdot \|\mathbf{x}\|$ |

### Some Notes:

1. **Anomaly detection.** Because templates adapt to the "normal" manifold and repel each other to cover it efficiently, an input that yields very low raw similarities across all templates (or requires a massive pull force) can be immediately flagged as an anomaly.

2. **The inhibition scaling term is a heuristic.** The term $\text{inh}_i = (A - a_{\text{raw},i}) / (A + \epsilon)$ ensures that a template with a large share of the total activation gets pushed less. The motivation is reasonable (don't destabilize well-specialized templates), but the functional form is somewhat arbitrary. Why this fraction and not, say, a softmax-weighted version, or a rank-based scaling? There's no theoretical derivation — it's a design choice that could meaningfully affect convergence behavior.

3. **Scale sensitivity and population size.** The shadow overlap $\sum_{j \neq i} a_j \cdot (\mathbf{w}_i \cdot \mathbf{w}_j)$ grows with $N$ (number of templates). For a large population, even moderate pairwise overlaps accumulate into strong inhibition, which could suppress *all* templates below the ReLU threshold. The algorithm may become overly sparse or even degenerate (all activations zero) for large $N$ and high-dimensional inputs. The document doesn't discuss how the algorithm behaves as $N$ scales — this is a critical gap.


4. **No vanishing gradient.** Because it doesn't compute a global $\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_{\text{recon}}$ error gradient, the algorithm doesn't suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.
